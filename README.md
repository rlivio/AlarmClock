Alarm Clock with Arduino Star OTTO

My project is an Alarm Clock with the board Arduino Star Otto with Arduino Star LCD.
The brightness change with ambient light, low during the night.
The Alarm will sound a music from the SD Card, the loudness will increase from zero to a specified value.
The clock will be synchronized with a GPS module.
Will be possible to set a Sleep with music from SD Card, the loudness will decrease from a specified value to zero.

Now the development is in process on a board from ST, the STM32F469I-Discovery, very similar to the next Star OTTO, when the Arduino Star OTTO will be available the project will switch on this board.
